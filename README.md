# Team-Profile-Generator-Zoran
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

Our challenge was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Because testing is key to making code maintainable, we’ll also write unit tests for each part of your code and ensure that it passes all of them.
Because this application won’t be deployed, we also provided a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing.
